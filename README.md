# upcloud-api

A Javascript client for the UpCloud API

## Installing `upcloud-api`

`upcloud-api` is available as a Node module on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) and can simply be installed with:

```
npm install upcloud-api
```

## Including `upcloud-api` in your scripts/applications

To use `upcloud-api` you need to include it in your scripts:

```
const uc = require("upcloud-api");
```

Or, if you aren't installing with `npm`, you can simply clone this repository and directly reference `upcloud-api.js`:

```
const uc = require("/path/to/upcloud-api.js");
```

## Initialisation

To initialise `upcloud-api` you need an UpCloud username and password for an account or subaccount with permission to access the UpCloud API. You can learn more about creating accounts with API permission in [Upcloud's documentation](https://upcloud.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-upcloud-api/).

Once you have the appropriate username and password you can initialise `upcloud-api` with:

```
uc.init(USERNAME_GOES_HERE,PASSWORD_GOES_HERE);
```

## Scope and Roadmap

This is an early pre-release of `upcloud-api` with many limitations:

1. This release only covers a handful of UpCloud API capabilities:
  * Getting a list of servers,
  * Getting a server's details,
  * Creating a server,
  * Getting list of storage templates,
  * Cloning storage from a template, and
  * Attaching storage to a server.
2. There is no error handling yet in `upcloud-api` so if you fail to authenticate, fail to connect to the UpCloud API or there is an error in the data passed to the API, `upcloud-api` will fail without any error handling and your script will terminate with an error.

This version currently uses version 1.3 of the UpCloud API.

## Using `upcloud-api`

### Invoking the API

All interaction with the API through `upcloud-api` is done through the `call` method of `upcloud-api`. The syntax for the `call` method is:

```
uc.call(COMMAND_NAME, PARAMETERS, POST_DATA, CALLBACK_FUNCTION);
```

The four arguments are:

* `COMMAND_NAME`: The name of an `upcloud-api` command as discussed below.
* `PARAMETERS`: An object containing one or more parameters required by the command being invoked.
* `DATA`: An object containing data to be sent as JSON in a POST request to the UpCloud API for commands which require POST requests with JSON data in the body of the request. To determine what data to send in a POST request, refer to the [UpCloud API documentation](https://developers.upcloud.com/1.3/).
* `CALLBACK_FUNCTION`: A function to invoke when the UpCloud API responds to the command. Three arguments will be sent to a single function containing the JSON object returned by the UpCloud API.

For instance, to retrieve a list of servers you could use:

```
uc.call("listServers", {}, {}, (res) => {
  console.log(res);
});
```

Or, to retrieve a server's specific details:

```
uc.call("serverDetails", { serveruuid: SERVER_UUID_HERE }, {}, (res) => {
  console.log(res);
});
```

Or, to attach storage to a server:

```
uc.call("createServer", { serveruuid: SERVER_UUID_HERE }, {
  storage_device": {
    type: "disk",
    address: "virtio",
    storage: "STORAGE_TEMPLATE_UUID_HERE",
    boot_disk: 0
  }
}, (res) => {
  console.log(res);
});
```
